When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)


df_quarterly <- read_csv("~/Desktop/nba-bucks-margin-by-quarter/notebooks/bucks_quarterly_scoring.csv")





df_long <- df_quarterly %>%
  pivot_longer(

    names_to = "Team",
    values_to = "Points"
  )
